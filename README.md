# NBA Game Day Notifications / Sports Alerts System

## **Project Overview**
This project is an alert system that sends real-time NBA game day score notifications to subscribed users via SMS/Email. It leverages **Amazon SNS**, **AWS Lambda and Python**, **Amazon EvenBridge** and **NBA APIs** to provide sports fans with up-to-date game information. The project demonstrates how we will can use Infrastructure as code with leveraging Terraform to automate the deployement and destruction of this solution in seconds.

## **Features**
- Fetches live NBA game scores using an external API.
- Sends formatted score updates to subscribers via SMS/Email using Amazon SNS.
- Scheduled automation for regular updates using Amazon EventBridge.

## **Setup Instructions**

### **Clone the Repository**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/ifeanyiro9/game-day-notifications.git
cd game-day-notifications
```

### **Store API Key as secret in Parameter story**
1. Run this aws cli command wit h your api key to store it in Paremeter store
```bash
aws ssm put-parameter --name "nba-api-key" --value "<API_KEY>" --type "SecureString"
```

### **Run Terraform commands**
1. Initialize providers and local backend
```bash
terraform init
```
2. Navigate to the Subscriptions tab and click Create subscription.
```bash
terraform fmt
```
3. Navigate to the Subscriptions tab and click Create subscription.
```bash
terraform validate
```
4. Navigate to the Subscriptions tab and click Create subscription.
```bash
terraform plan
```
5. Navigate to the Subscriptions tab and click Create subscription.
```bash
terraform apply
```
6. Navigate to the Subscriptions tab and click Create subscription.
```bash
terraform destory
```

4. Click Create Subscription.
5. If you added an Email subscription:
- Check the inbox of the provided email address.
- Confirm the subscription by clicking the confirmation link in the email.
6. For SMS, the subscription will be immediately active after creation.





### **Test the System**
1. Open the Lambda function in the AWS Management Console.
2. Create a test event to simulate execution.
3. Run the function and check CloudWatch Logs for errors.
4. Verify that SMS notifications are sent to the subscribed users.


### **What We Learned**
1. Designing a notification system with AWS SNS and Lambda.
2. Securing AWS services with least privilege IAM policies.
3. Automating workflows using EventBridge.
4. Integrating external APIs into cloud-based workflows.


### **Future Enhancements**
1. Add NFL score alerts for extended functionality.
2. Store user preferences (teams, game types) in DynamoDB for personalized alerts.
3. Implement a web UI
